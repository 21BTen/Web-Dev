        <h2>History of Japan</h2>
        <p>In the <em>Paleolithic era</em>, the Japanese islands were connected to the mainland by isthmuses.Local ceramics, which appeared about 10 thousand years ago, is considered the oldest in the world. And in the annals of the <strong>Chinese Han Empire</strong> (I century A.D.), there are the first mentions of ancient Japan, inhabited by the Wajin people, who had "100 small countries".</p>

        <p>"There was a definite trend toward unification around one of the states, Yamato, which later developed into a federation, as early as the IV century. <em>Prince Setoku</em>, the country's monarch around the end of the VIth century, started the process of centralization. The monarch published the fabled <em>"Constitution of 17 Articles"</em> in 604, declaring the monarchy to be the ultimate power.".</p>
        <p>At the same time, there was a strengthening of the <strong>samurai</strong>, who were accepted to key positions of the imperial court. They positioned themselves as a separate class and often rebelled against the government.</p>

        <p>European navigators started traveling to East Asia in the sixteenth century. They landed on Tanegashima, a Japanese island, in 1543 and taught the locals how to make <strong>weapons</strong>, which led to their widespread production in Japan.</p>
        <p>The beginning of the XX century was marked by the growth of militaristic and expansionist sentiments in the country. Japan joined the <strong>First World War</strong>, becoming an ally of the <strong>Entente</strong>. As a result, its influence increased, territorial acquisitions multiplied.</p>

            Main sights of Japan
        </h2>

            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Kyoto_FushimiInari01.jpg/373px-Kyoto_FushimiInari01.jpg" alt = "Japan" width = "370">
            <p>The <strong>Fushimi-Inari Temple</strong>, also known as <em>the Sanctuary of a Thousand Scarlet Gates</em> and devoted to the goddess of rice fertility, is one of the historical emblems of Japan. According to Shintoism, massive tunnels with portals meant for the gods were built. The Fushimi-Inari Temple is regarded by the Japanese as a successful and prosperous place.</p>
            <li><strong class = "sights">Heavenly Tree (Tokyo)</strong></li>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Tokyo_Sky_Tree_2012.JPG/640px-Tokyo_Sky_Tree_2012.JPG" alt = "Japan" width = "270">
             <p>The second-tallest television tower in the world is the <strong>Tokyo Sky Tree</strong>. Thanks to the efforts of skilled architects and engineers, this exquisite building built of metal, concrete, and glass soars high. The building rises to a height of 634 meters. On this endeavor, half a million people were employed.</p>
            <li><strong class = "sights">Hakone</strong></li>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/LakeAshi_and_MtFuji_Hakone.JPG" alt = "Japan" width = "370">
             <p><strong>Hakone</strong>, a national park and resort region southeast of Fujiyama, is a favorite weekend getaway destination for Tokyo residents. The park is a great spot for a quick vacation if you need to escape the busy city life due to the abundance of lakes and hot springs, sanctuaries, and art museums, as well as its close proximity to Tokyo.</p>
        </ol>
    <p id = "end">With a thousand-year history, unique culture, and traditions, <strong>Japan</strong> is one of the world's most developed nations. It is a land of contrasts, with rice-growing rural hinterland and opulent Tokyo, Buddhist monks and teenage fashionistas, somber religious rites and the clamor of patinko gambling halls, beautiful temple architecture and multi-story concrete buildings.</p>
